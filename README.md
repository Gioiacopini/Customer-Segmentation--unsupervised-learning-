# Customer Segmentation

The aim of this project is to perform customer segmentation on a dataset of e-commerce transactions. The data in question is an open source dataset created by the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing 541,909 E-commerce transactions dated from 01/12/2010 until 09/12/2011 (UCI, 2018).

I have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.com, a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions which stores open source datasets uploaded by companies or users (Kaggle, 2018).

The data set contains transactional data of a UK-based online retailer that sells unique all occasion gifts to wholesales and end users. The data set variabled are explained below:

* InvoiceNo: Nominal. Transaction unique identifier. If this code starts with the letter 'C', the order was cancelled
* StockCode: Nominal. Product unique identifier 
* Description: Nominal. Product name
* Quantity: Numeric. The quantities of each product per transactio. 	
* InvoiceDate: Numeric. Invice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated. 
* UnitPrice: Numeric. Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling. 
* CustomerID: Nominal. Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer. 
* Country: Nominal. Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

The project is divided into four main sections: 
1. Introduction 
1.	Data pre-processing
